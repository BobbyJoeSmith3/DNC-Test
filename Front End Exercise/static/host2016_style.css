	/* The color of the background for the banner is going to be white, but I need to set it to a color that I can see while adjusting it, since the default background of the page is white. Since the default background color is white, and the Host2016logo.png banner image is transparent, I could just place the image without creaing a white background, but I conceptually like the idea having a div that serves as the complete banner, image, background and all. */
